# Exploring Image Processing and Text Detection with Python 
## Introduction:<p>
    1.Preprocessing:Download an image and apply various preprocessing techniques.<p>
    2.EAST Text Detection: Use the EAST model to detect text in images.<p>
    3.Extract and Display Text: Use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tool Tesseract to extract text from the detected regions. Display the extracted text and the annotated image with bounding boxes.<p>

## Technologies Used

    1.OpenCV: For image processing tasks such as grayscale conversion, thresholding, and contour detection.
    2.Requests:A Python HTTP library used for making HTTP requests
    3.PaddleOCR: A deep learning-based OCR tool used to recognize and extract text from images.
    4.NumPy: For handling arrays and image data.
    5.Tesseract-OCR:An open-source OCR engine used for recognizing text in images.

## Installation

1.Install Python and Dependencies: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine. Install the required dependencies using pip:
    
    pip install opencv-python-headless numpy paddlepaddle paddleocr pillow

2.Install tesseract
